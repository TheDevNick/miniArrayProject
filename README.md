# miniArrayProject
## Usage
This is a mini array project that incorporate arrays and DOM manipulation.
I created this to get a better understanding of how arrays work and how they could be used. 
This is a extreme basic pizza order project where once you click the button it shows what type of pizza you ordered based on the items in the array.
